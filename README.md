# Data-Curation-Project

This github repo contains the code and the data behind the blog post about NBA analytics. The blog post can be found at https://dsumsio.github.io/stat386_blog/blog/NBA-Patterns-Data-Curation/

The file 'data_analytics.ipynb' contains all the code that was used to make the plots and do the analysis. There are several plots included in this file that were not included in the final blog post. 

The file 'getdata.ipynb' contains the code that was used to obtain the data for the blog post.

The file 'sports_data.csv' is the data that is used for the blog post.

The files 'post2plot1.png' and 'post2plot2.png' are generated from the 'data_analytics.ipynb' file and are plots that are used in the blog post.

The file '.gitignore' contains the file link to my apikey and thus is not shared to ensure security of ethical practices
